<h1>Hi {{ name }}</h1>

<p>You are the {{ position }} to accept this client.  This client will now be shown your profile ({{ order }}!) and profiles for two other concierges.  If he accepts your profile, you will receive an email connecting you two.  You should then call him immediately to discuss what he needs for his trip.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
